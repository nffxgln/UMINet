# UMINet
The UMINet is a unified multi-modality interaction network for RGB-D and RGB-T salient object detection. We provide the saliency results on RGB-D and RGB-T SOD datasets, including NLPR, NJUD, SIP, ReDWeb-S, COME-E, COME-H, VT821, VT1000, and VT5000. These saliency results can be found from the BaiduYun(https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZE1kaPEazvExqs8oV_vOMA 5010)
